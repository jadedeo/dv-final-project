        <p>
          When the Atlantic Slave Trade was abolished in the 19th century,
          nations such as Britain, France & the Netherlands still required labor
          for their plantation colonies. To meet this demand, so began the era
          of the Indian Indenture System (1838-1920), forcing the migration of
          approximately 2 million South Asians from their homelands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colonies such as British Guiana (now Guyana), Trinidad & Tobago,
          Suriname, Natal (now part of South Africa), Mauritius & more received
          some of the largest populations of indentured laborers. This project
          focuses on these countries, though note that others (RÃ©union, Grenada,
          St. Vincent, etc.) are part of the same story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, a significant portion of the resulting diaspora now live
          somewhere in the West & would be considered "twice-removed". Though
          the following addresses social issues that were exaccerbated by
          indentureship in the ex-colonies themselves, they are still instances
          of intergenerational trauma that continue to follow present-day
          descendents of indenture.
